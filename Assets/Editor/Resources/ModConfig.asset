  description: 'To celebrate Colored Cube''s 2 year (minus 1 day) anniversary, I present
    to you... Colored Cube Variants!

    A pack of five (and more to come) modules, which are variants of the original
    Colored Cube!

    They all might look the same, but their solving processes... :3

    Modules currently in the pack:

    * Not Colored Cube

    * Recolored Cube

    * Decolored Cube

    * Uncolored Cube

    * Discolored Cube
