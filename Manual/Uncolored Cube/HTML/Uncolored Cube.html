                <h2>On the Subject of Uncolored Cube</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Who knew there would even be gambling with cubes?</p>
                <p>
                    This module contains a Colored Cube, which can be either (R)ed, (G)reen, (B)lue, (Y)ellow, (M)agenta, (C)yan, (W)hite or Blac(K).
                    The cube is split into two selectable halves: one is located mostly on the cube’s front face, and other is located is located mostly on the cube’s back face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this module, you will be judging a “card” game called <strong>Colocuber</strong> - the rules of this game can be found in <strong>Appendix COLOCUBER</strong>.
                    Make sure to thoroughly familiarize yourself with the game’s rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, you have agreed with one of the players to make them win by telling them some information they wouldn’t usually know, and in exchange - they will solve this module.
                    Your player’s opponent is an experienced Colocuber player - don’t let them see through your lies!
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Your player’s opponent always goes first - their played cube will be on the module.
                    Your next cube press (the pressed half and the seconds on the timer at the time of the press, called <u>T</u>) will send a message that will determine what cube your player will play:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Take <u>T</u> modulo 8, then add 1 to obtain <u>C</u>.
                        Your player will play a cube with the color with the value equal to <u>C</u>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Divide <u>T</u> by 7 and drop decimals if needed.
                        If you pressed the front-face half of the cube, negate the result (write it with a “-” sign).
                        If you pressed the back-face half of the cube, keep the result as is (write it with a “+” sign).
                        Finally, add the new result to the opponent’s played cube’s number value to obtain <u>N</u>.
                        Your player will play a cube with the number value equal to <u>N</u>.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If <u>N</u> goes below 1 or above 10, your player will fully ignore your message.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After you send your message, the cube that your player played will be on the module.
                    Now you must judge the played round: if your player won, press the back-face half; if the opponent won, press the front-face half.
